Welcome! This repository showcases some of my projects in algorithmic trading, market making, and quantitative betting strategies. These projects are currently private, but Iâ€™m happy to share details upon request.

ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Arbitrage Strategy
A mean-reversion trading strategy that identifies tradable asset pairs using the Graphical LASSO (GLASSO) algorithm for covariance estimation and DBSCAN clustering for robust pair selection.

ðŸŽ² +EV Sports Betting Strategy
A systematic approach to betting that exploits odds inefficiencies in local bookmakers. The strategy detects odds drops in efficient markets (Pinnacle) and compares them to inefficient bookie odds, identifying profitable bets based on no-vig pricing.

ðŸš€ ERC-20 Trading Bot
An automated trading bot designed to capitalize on newly launched ERC-20 tokens. It monitors token launches, extracts fundamental metrics, and executes trades based on a custom-built predictive model.
